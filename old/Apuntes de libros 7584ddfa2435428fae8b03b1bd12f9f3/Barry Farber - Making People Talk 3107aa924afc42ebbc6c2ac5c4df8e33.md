# Chapters

## #1: Making People Talk

- Is there a way to convert resistance into acceptance? How do you convert human roadblocks into native guides, dissidents into lubricants?
    - There is a way. It works. And it’s elementary. It involves learning some principles. “Principles” may be too pompous a word. They’re more like games.
    - The “game” has an objective. The objective is not what you may think it is. It isn’t getting the job, getting the sale, getting the date; getting the variance, the approval, the improvement, the permission. That’s the second objective. The prime objective is—Get Them Talking.

## #2: Ready

Some consider it something close to a sin to “cultivate” a person as a friend in hope of some future gain, specific or vague. Others consider it a waste of time to socialize with anybody who can’t do them any good.

The two attitudes divide, like classes on Russian trains, into “soft” and “hard.” Let’s call individuals within these classes soft-hearts and hard-hearts.

The “soft” attitude has kept a lot of talented people unnecessarily trapped in mediocrity. That notion says, “People are not things to be used only when needed or when it’s advantageous. I will not abuse fellowship and conviviality by even allowing the suspicion to germinate that my opportunism supersedes my fraternal motives in showing niceness to others.”

The “hard” shouts back, “Quit worrying about appearing opportunistic in your dealings with other people. Grow up and recognize that people are opportunities.”

To suppose that hard-hearts are nothing but crass and pushy opportunists who use people “like tin cans” and then smash them and throw them away when they’re through with them is either soft-heart propaganda (the Loser’s Lament) or describes awfully unskilled hard-hearts.

For every successful person out there succeeding, there are a hundred who know him who are sitting around crabbing about the way he “uses” people. The best position—the one to get ready for—is somewhere safely in from the extreme, **but definitely on the hard side of the middle**. The argument is not about whether to use or not to use. It’s to use tastefully or distastefully: with grace or with gall; in a manner that leaves the one being “cultivated” thinking, “What a delight doing favors for you. Do call again!” or in a manner that repels him as well as all observing bystanders.

The hardness I suggest does not call for treating people like tin cans. It demands they be treated more like treasured zucchini to be dusted and petted and placed lovingly upon protective green confetti in the display bin.

“Smash them and throw them away when they’re through with them!” What rot! What an awful transmogrification of the “hard” doctrine. Skilled hard-hearts realize you’re never through with them! Anyone who can help you once might help you twice!

Soft-hearts see a difference between personal friends and business associates. Each is clearly enough defined in the “soft” mind to be wearing an armband, and different rules apply to each.

“Personal” friends are those we like spending time with because we like them. They may do us favors, and big ones, but that’s not usually why they were initially enlisted as friends. Personal friends are the ones we relax with. They’re the ones we rejoice with because we actually like each other, in praiseworthy contrast to those opportunistic dogs who will court anybody, kiss anybody, and spend time with anybody in their remorseless lunge for success.

That’s the soft line, and it’s devastatingly seductive. It engulfs most decent people for the course of their entire lives. It’s the easier philosophy to accept. It seems nicer.

It just isn’t true.

Some of the best friendships, some of the best laughs, the best moments, the most vibrating, pulsating fun takes place at parties where not one single relationship was founded on soft-hearted “affection!”
