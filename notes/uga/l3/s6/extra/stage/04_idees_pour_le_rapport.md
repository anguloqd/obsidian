- My method of false positive filtering is most likely not good or only valid in veeeeery specific situations, particularly when the false positives caused by noise are not strong (it is a non-Bayesian method, which is weird)
- So : starting with reflexions on my developped method
- Then : application of BEAST in all of the municipalities (good indexes like LST, bad indexes like NDVI). Observations on the distribution of changepoints.
- One of these two : filtering false positives with Bayesian methods, or optimization (machine learning) applied to BEAST
